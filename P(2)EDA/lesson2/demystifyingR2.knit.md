Demystifying R Part 2
========================================================

You might see a warning message just above this file. Something like...
"R Markdown requires the knitr package (version 1.2 or higher)"
Don't worry about this for now. We'll address it at the end of this file.

1. Run the following command to see what it does.

```r
summary(mtcars)
```

```
##       mpg             cyl             disp             hp

##  Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000
```

If you know about quantiles, then the output should look familiar.
If not, you probably recognize the min (minimum), median, mean, and max (maximum).
We'll go over quantiles in Lesson 3 so don't worry if the output seems overwhelming.

The str() and summary() functions are helpful commands when working with a new data set.
The str() function gives us the variable names and their types.
The summary() function gives us an idea of the values a variable can take on.

2. In 2013, the average mpg (miles per gallon) for a car was 23 mpg.
The car models in the mtcars data set come from the year 1973-1974.
Subset the data so that you create a new data frame that contains
cars that get 23 or more mpg (miles per gallon). Save it to a new data
frame called efficient.

```r
carsubset<- subset(mtcars,mpg >= 23)
```

3. How many cars get more than 23 mpg? Use one of the commands you
learned in the demystifying.R to answer this question.

```r
dim(carsubset)
```

```
## [1]  7 11
```

4. We can also use logical operators to find out which car(s) get greater
than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) and have more than 100 raw horsepower.

```r
subset(mtcars, mpg >= 30 & hp > 100)
```

```
##               mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt qsec vs am gear carb
## Lotus Europa 30.4   4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.9  1  1    5    2
```

There's only one car that gets more than 30 mpg and 100 hp.

5. What do you think this code does? Scroll down for the answer.

```r
subset(mtcars, mpg < 14 | disp > 390)
```

```
##                      mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Cadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8  472 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4
## Lincoln Continental 10.4   8  460 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4
## Chrysler Imperial   14.7   8  440 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4
## Camaro Z28          13.3   8  350 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4
## Pontiac Firebird    19.2   8  400 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2
```

Note: You may be familiar with the || operator in Java. R uses one single & for the logical
operator AND. It also uses one | for the logical operator OR.








The command above creates a data frame of cars that have mpg less than 14
OR a displacement of more than 390. Only one of the conditions for a car
needs to be satisfied so that the car makes it into the subset. Any of the
cars that fit the criteria are printed to the console.

Now you try some.

6. Print the cars that have a 1/4 mile time (qsec) less than or equal to
16.90 seconds to the console. Do Note that the bracket notation to code syntax.

```r
mtcars[mtcars$qsec <=16.90, ]
```

```
##                   mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Mazda RX4        21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
## Duster 360       14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4
## Dodge Challenger 15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2
## Camaro Z28       13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4
## Porsche 914-2    26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2
## Lotus Europa     30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2
## Ford Pantera L   15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4
## Ferrari Dino     19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6
## Maserati Bora    15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8
```

7. Save the subset of cars that weigh under 2000 pounds (weight is measured in lb/1000)
to a variable called lightCars. Print the numbers of cars and the subset to the console.

```r
lightCars <- subset(mtcars,wt<2.00 )
lightCars
```

```
##                 mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Honda Civic    30.4   4 75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2
## Toyota Corolla 33.9   4 71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1
## Fiat X1-9      27.3   4 79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1
## Lotus Europa   30.4   4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2
```

8. You can also create new variables in a data frame. Let's say you wanted
to have the year of each car's model. We can create the variable
mtcars$year. Here we'll assume that all of the models were from 1974.
Run the code below.

```r
mtcars$year <- 1974
```

Notice how the number of variables changed in the work space. You can
also see the result by double clicking on mtcars in the workspace and
examining the data in a table.

To drop a variable, subset the data frame and select the variable you
want to drop with a negative sign in front of it.

```r
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)
```

Notice, we are back to 11 variables in the data frame.

9. What do you think this code does? Run it to find out.

```r
mtcars$year <- c(1973, 1974)
head(mtcars)
```

```
##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb year
## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4 1973
## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4 1974
## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1 1973
## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1 1974
## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2 1973
## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1 1974
```

Open the table of values to see what values year takes on.

Drop the year variable from the data set.

```r
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)
```


10. Now you are going to get a preview of ifelse(). For those new
to programming this example may be confusing. See if you can understand
the code by running the commands one line at a time. Read the output and
make sense of what the code is doing at each step.

If you are having trouble don't worry, we will review the ifelse statement
at the end of Lesson 3. You won't be quizzed on it, and it's not essential
to keep going in this course. We just want you to try to get familiar with
more code.

```r
mtcars$wt
```

```
##  [1] 2.620 2.875 2.320 3.215 3.440 3.460 3.570 3.190 3.150 3.440 3.440
## [12] 4.070 3.730 3.780 5.250 5.424 5.345 2.200 1.615 1.835 2.465 3.520
## [23] 3.435 3.840 3.845 1.935 2.140 1.513 3.170 2.770 3.570 2.780
```

```r
cond <- mtcars$wt < 3
cond
```

```
##  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [12] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
## [23] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')
mtcars$weight_class
```

```
##  [1] "light"   "light"   "light"   "average" "average" "average" "average"
##  [8] "average" "average" "average" "average" "average" "average" "average"
## [15] "average" "average" "average" "light"   "light"   "light"   "light"  
## [22] "average" "average" "average" "average" "light"   "light"   "light"  
## [29] "average" "light"   "average" "light"
```

```r
cond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)
mtcars$weight_class
```

```
##  [1] "light"   "light"   "light"   "average" "average" "average" "heavy"  
##  [8] "average" "average" "average" "average" "heavy"   "heavy"   "heavy"  
## [15] "heavy"   "heavy"   "heavy"   "light"   "light"   "light"   "light"  
## [22] "heavy"   "average" "heavy"   "heavy"   "light"   "light"   "light"  
## [29] "average" "light"   "heavy"   "light"
```

You have some variables in your workspace or environment like 'cond' and
efficient. You want to be careful that you don't bring in too much data
into R at once since R will hold all the data in working memory. We have
nothing to worry about here, but let's delete those variables from the
work space.


```r
rm(cond)
rm(efficient)
```

```
## Warning in rm(efficient): object 'efficient' not found
```

Save this file if you haven't done so yet.


You'll have the opportunity to create one Rmd file for the final project in
this class and submit the Rmd file and knitted output (or HTML file). You'll
need the knitr package to do that so let's install that now. **Uncomment** the
following two lines of code and run them.


```r
#install.packages('knitr', dependencies = T)
#library(knitr)
```

Once you've installed knitr, **comment** out the two lines of code above.
When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that
includes both content (text and text formatting from Markdown) as well as
the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


You've reached the end of the file so now it's time to write some code to
answer a question to continue on in Lesson 2.

Which car(s) have an mpg (miles per gallon) greater than or equal to 30
OR hp (horsepower) less than 60? Create an R chunk of code to answer the question.

```r
subset(mtcars, mpg < 30 | hp < 60)
```

```
##                      mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
